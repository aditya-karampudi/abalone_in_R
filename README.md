## Baby steps into machine Learning- My first work on a dataset.

Although I became aware of the algorithms, I never worked on any dataset. 

So as a part of learning. I have started working on Abalone dataset. Used all of learning and thinking and applied different models and did few transformation. 

These are my first R code lines.
