## Baby steps into machine Learning- My first work on a dataset.

Although I became aware of the algorithms, I never worked on any dataset. 

So as a part of learning. I have started working on Abalone dataset. Used all of learning and thinking and applied different models and did few transformation. 

These are my first R code lines.

### Packages needed are
glmnet
FNN
e1071
corrplot
vegan
Metrics
MASS
rpart
caret

## Data Set Information:

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem. 

## Attribute Information:
The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. But as there are 29 values and the number of records are just 4177. I have took it as regression problem 

### Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description 

Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant) 

Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement 

Diameter	/ continuous / mm / perpendicular to length 

Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell 

Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone 

Shucked weight / continuous	/ grams / weight of meat 

Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding) 

Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried 

Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
